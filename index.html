      <h1>About Dayne</h1>

      <p>Hello, my name is Dayne. I am a USMC veteran from Seattle, WA who enjoys working on cars and motorcycles. I have a new found passion for coding that began once I started this course and I am ecstatic to learn more. My ultimate goal after becoming an effective Software Developer is to learn how to program the computers in vehicles.</p>
